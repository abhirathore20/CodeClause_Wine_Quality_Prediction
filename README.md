# Description
I developed a number of classification models to determine whether a specific red wine is "good quality" or not for this project using Kaggle's Red Wine Quality dataset. Each wine in this dataset is assigned a "quality" score, which ranges from 0 to 8. For the sake of this research, I transformed the results to a binary output, where each wine is either "good quality" (a score of 7 or more) or not (a score below 7). In this case, I built my prediction model using the Random Forest Algorithm.
